# Progress: uusd.ubq.fi

## What Works:
- The core monorepo structure is established, separating smart contracts and the dapp.
- Smart contract development and testing environment (Foundry) is set up.
- Frontend development environment (Next.js, React, TypeScript, Bun) is configured.
- Basic interaction with the blockchain from the frontend is functional through services.

## What's Left to Build:
- Full implementation and integration of all Algorithmic Market Operations (AMOs).
- User interface enhancements and feature completeness for the dapp.

## Current Status:
- Documentation reinitialization is in progress.
- Core protocol components are in place, but require further development and integration.

## Known Issues:
- (No specific known issues identified during this initial audit, but this section will be populated as development progresses.)
