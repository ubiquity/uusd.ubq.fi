# UUSD DeFi Application Refactoring Project

## Project Overview

The UUSD (Ubiquity Dollar) DeFi application is a decentralized stablecoin platform that enables users to mint and redeem UUSD tokens using various collateral types. This project focuses on refactoring the current monolithic codebase into a maintainable, modular architecture.

## Current State

- **Monolithic Structure**: Single 807-line `app.ts` file containing all application logic
- **Mixed Responsibilities**: Wallet management, contract interactions, UI logic, and price calculations all in one class
- **Tight Coupling**: Business logic tightly bound to DOM elements
- **Limited Testability**: Difficult to unit test due to lack of separation of concerns

## Refactoring Goals

### Primary Objective: Separation of Concerns
Transform the monolithic `UUSDApp` class into a clean, modular architecture with distinct layers:

1. **Services Layer**: Business logic and blockchain interactions
2. **Components Layer**: UI logic and user interaction handling
3. **Utils Layer**: Pure functions for calculations and formatting
4. **Types Layer**: TypeScript definitions and interfaces
5. **Contracts Layer**: Smart contract ABIs and address management

### Key Success Criteria

- **Maintainability**: Each module has a single responsibility
- **Testability**: Pure functions and dependency injection enable comprehensive testing
- **Scalability**: New features can be added without modifying existing modules
- **Type Safety**: Comprehensive TypeScript coverage across all modules
- **Developer Experience**: Clear interfaces and documentation for all components

## Core Requirements

### Functional Requirements
- **Mint UUSD**: Users can mint stablecoins using collateral and governance tokens
- **Redeem UUSD**: Users can redeem stablecoins for underlying assets
- **Collect Redemptions**: Users can collect their redeemed assets after processing
- **Wallet Integration**: Seamless connection with MetaMask and other Web3 wallets
- **Real-time Updates**: Dynamic calculation of mint/redeem outputs based on market conditions

### Technical Requirements
- **Preserve Functionality**: All existing features must work identically post-refactoring
- **Maintain Performance**: No degradation in user experience or transaction speeds
- **Error Handling**: Robust error handling across all layers
- **State Management**: Consistent state management for wallet and transaction status

## Architecture Principles

1. **Single Responsibility**: Each module handles one specific domain
2. **Dependency Injection**: Services are injected rather than directly instantiated
3. **Interface Segregation**: Clean contracts between modules
4. **Pure Functions**: Business logic separated from side effects
5. **Immutable Data**: State changes handled through pure transformations

## Success Metrics

- **Code Maintainability**: Average file length < 200 lines
- **Test Coverage**: >90% coverage for all business logic
- **Build Performance**: Development build time < 5 seconds
- **Bundle Size**: Production bundle size maintained or reduced
- **Developer Onboarding**: New developers can understand architecture in < 1 day

## Constraints

- **No Breaking Changes**: Existing API contracts must be preserved
- **Incremental Migration**: Application must remain functional during refactoring
- **Technology Preservation**: Continue using TypeScript, Bun, Viem, and esbuild
- **Browser Compatibility**: Maintain current browser support levels
